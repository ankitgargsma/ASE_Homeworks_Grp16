1. **Does SMO do better than the random baselines (see prints 1,2,4)?**   
Yes. One line from most: 3. most: [2160.0, 14.5, 40.0] One line from rand: 4: rand:[3387.54, 15.88, 20.0] Almost comparable accelerations but wins in Lbs and Mpg. Although the range of values in print 6 varies more, one/two of the three values are closest to heaven, making it one of the best rows seen in the iteration.

2. **How many y-row evaluations are required for print 3?**   
One per row, 398. "sort ROWS on "distance to heaven" ", sorts all rows

3. **How does SMO do compared to absolute best (print 3)**    
It provides a good approximate value, and usually provides answers that maximize one value over others. Sometimes does provide a value that isn't great, but overall is much better than random selection. Examples:
most: [3360.0, 16.6, 20.0]
most: [3651.0, 17.7, 20.0]
most: [3632.0, 18.0, 20.0]
most: [2671.0, 13.5, 30.0]
most: [2164.0, 22.1, 20.0]
most: [2815.0, 14.5, 20.0]
most: [2711.0, 15.5, 30.0]
most: [3302.0, 15.5, 20.0]
most: [3353.0, 14.5, 20.0]
most: [2350.0, 16.8, 30.0] It tries to keep Mpg around 20-30, acceleration over/around 15 and then minimize Lbs, none above 4000 especially.
